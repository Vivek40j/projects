#Image Based Angle Measurement For Metal Formation In Laser Cutting

This project is made to measure the angle for metal formation in laser cutting
machines in our college. Here we do it by using a machine vision application which is hands-free measurement using image acquisition and image processing techniques. We take picture of the metal and measure the angle formed after laser cutting by using its image.
The advantage of measuring angle for metal formation is that there is no such equipment available to measure this angle. In our college lab also there is no equipment available to measure these angles. So we decided to solve this problem from our lab.
